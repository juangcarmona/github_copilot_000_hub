# Plan-to-Implementation Handoff

Once the plan is approved, hand it off to the coding agent or Copilot CLI for task-by-task execution. Each task traces back to a plan step.

</div>

<!--
The handoff is where planning connects to implementation:

Options after plan approval:
1. Continue in the same session — the agent implements step by step
2. Open in Copilot CLI — run implementation in the background
3. Save to memory — review later, implement in a new session

Implementation traceability:
- Every code change maps to a plan step
- Every plan step maps to a requirement
- If output doesn't match the plan → fix the implementation
- If the plan doesn't match requirements → fix the plan first

This is the same discipline as TDD elevated to the feature level:
- TDD: test defines correctness → implementation satisfies the test
- SDD: plan defines correctness → implementation satisfies the plan
