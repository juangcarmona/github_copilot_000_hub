```

├── utils.js              ← 2400 lines, everything
├── helpers.js            ← overlaps with utils.js

```

- Copilot suggests code that already exists elsewhere
- Completions reference wrong types
- Agents can't find relevant files
- Chat answers contradict the codebase

└── shared/
    └── money.ts          ← one clear utility
```

- Copilot infers intent from folder context
- Types are discoverable and scoped
- Agents navigate by convention
- Completions match domain boundaries

<!--
This slide establishes the anti-pattern first.

AI-hostile repositories share traits:
- God files that mix concerns
- Ambiguous naming that confuses embeddings
- Duplicated logic that creates contradictory context
- Missing boundaries that prevent scoped reasoning

The fix is structural, not tooling.
