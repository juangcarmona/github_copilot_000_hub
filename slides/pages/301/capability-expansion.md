# Capability Expansion Pattern

Each MCP server adds a capability domain. The agent sequences them into workflows.

  AG --> V["Verification<br/>Playwright · Postman"]
  AG --> D["Design<br/>Figma"]
  AG --> O["Operations<br/>Databases · CI/CD"]
```

- **Planning:** read the ticket, understand requirements
- **Verification:** run tests, validate contracts
- **Design:** extract component specs, design tokens
- **Operations:** query data, trigger pipelines

<!--
This frames MCP servers not as "plugins" but as capability domains.
The agent orchestrates across domains to deliver complete workflows.
This is the agentic shift: from "AI writes code" to "AI drives delivery."
Implementation (code generation) is always handled by the core agent - it doesn't need an MCP server.
