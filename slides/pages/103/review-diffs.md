## The review discipline

Every AI edit is a **pending change**. Treat it like a PR from a junior dev.

- Files with pending edits are marked for review
- Open the diff — read every changed line
- **Keep** what's correct, **Undo** what isn't
- Hover for line-level accept/reject

## Do not skip

Staging in Source Control auto-accepts pending edits.

Review first. Stage second.

Merged from review-discipline.md and review-controls.md.

The left side shows the changed files view (the big picture: which files changed).
The right side is the operational workflow: what to do with each pending change.

The "staging auto-accepts" warning is the most dangerous footgun — keep it.
