# Inspecting & Editing Tool Parameters

You can review and modify the parameters before a tool executes.

<div class="flex justify-center mt-4">

</div>

**Why this matters:**

- The agent chooses parameters autonomously — it might be wrong
- Prompt injection in tool outputs can influence subsequent calls
- A tool reading `../../.env` looks like a tool reading `src/config.ts` unless you inspect it

**Operational habit:** Expand tool details. Read the parameters. Then approve.

<!--
This is the "review what's actually happening" slide.
It connects to the prompt injection risk: malicious content from one tool can lead the agent to invoke another tool with dangerous parameters.
Inspecting parameters is the last line of defense before execution.
