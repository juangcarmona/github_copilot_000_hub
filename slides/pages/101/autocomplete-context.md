# What Autocomplete Sees

Autocomplete uses a **narrower context** than Chat.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-4">

<div class="leading-snug">

### High-signal sources
- Current file (above and below cursor)
- Open editor tabs (neighboring files)
- File name and language identifier
- Import statements and type signatures

### Not visible
- Closed files you haven't opened
- External dependency source code
- Runtime behavior

</div>

💡 **Tip:** Open related files in tabs — they become signal for autocomplete.

<!--
This explains the "open related files" tip: tabs are signal.
If you're working on a service, open the interface/types file in another tab.

Autocomplete doesn't search your workspace like Chat does — it works with what's immediately available.
