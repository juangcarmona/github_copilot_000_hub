# Workspace Indexing

How does `#codebase` find relevant code in a large project?

### Remote Index
GitHub-hosted search for repos on GitHub. Fast, scales to large codebases.

### Local Index
Semantic index on your machine. Works offline, good accuracy.

### Basic Fallback
Simple text matching. Used when other indexes aren't available.

### What this means for you

- **Open relevant files** - open tabs improve context quality
- **Use `#file` when you know exactly what's needed** - more precise than search
- **Use `#codebase` when exploring** - lets the index find relevant snippets
- **Workspace size matters** - smaller, focused workspaces produce better results

  <ul>
    <li>Prompts are only part of the real context.</li>
    <li>Chat history, instructions, and tools also consume tokens.</li>
    <li>Focused context improves quality and latency.</li>

<!--
This slide demystifies the "magic" of @workspace and #codebase.

It's not reading every file every time - it's searching an index.
The quality of that index determines how well broad queries work.

For workshop attendees: this explains why AI-ready repositories (203) matter.
A well-structured repo with clear file names and focused modules indexes better.
