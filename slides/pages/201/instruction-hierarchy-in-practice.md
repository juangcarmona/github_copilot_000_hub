## How They Stack

**Repo-wide** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
→ Applied to every interaction in the repo.
Use for: language, conventions, architecture rules, security standards.

**Path-specific** (`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`)
→ Applied only when Copilot is working in matched paths.
Use for: framework rules, test conventions, domain-specific patterns.

**Prompt files** (`.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`)
→ Reusable prompts invoked explicitly.
Use for: repeated workflows (code review, PR summary, onboarding).

This is the most important operational slide in Module 201.

The file map makes it concrete — show the actual paths.
Teams should be able to open their repo and know exactly where to create each file.

Key message: instruction files are first-class repo artifacts. They belong in version control, reviewed like code.

The agents/ path is shown here for completeness — it belongs to Module 202.

Lab exercise mapping:
- Exercise 02: create `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Exercise 03: create `.github/instructions/backend.instructions.md` with `applyTo: "**/*.cs"`
- Exercise 04: create `.github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md` with `applyTo: "**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"`
- Exercise 05: add architecture docs and ADRs to `docs/` — these become rich context for Copilot when referenced
- Exercise 06: create a second `.instructions.md` that conflicts with the root — observe unpredictable output; conclusion is that scoped instructions must specialize, not contradict
